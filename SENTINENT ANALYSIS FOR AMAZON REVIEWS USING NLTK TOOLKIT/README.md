Amazon Product Reviews Sentiment Analysis in Python
This project contains Python code that performs sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. The code uses natural language processing techniques to determine whether the reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.
Installation
To run the code, you need to install the following Python packages:
* pandas
* numpy
* nltk
* scikit-learn
You can install these packages using the pip package manager:

Use:
pip install 
pandas 
numpy
 nltk 
scikit-learn 
Usage
To use the code, you need to download the Amazon product reviews dataset from the Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset page. The dataset contains reviews for various products, and you can select the product category that you are interested in.
After downloading the dataset, you need to extract the reviews data and store it in a CSV file. You can then use the Python code to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews.
The main file for the project is amazon_reviews_sentiment_analysis.py. You can run this file using the following command:


python amazon_reviews_sentiment_analysis.py 
The code will read the reviews data from the CSV file and perform sentiment analysis on each review. The results will be displayed in the console, showing the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral reviews.
